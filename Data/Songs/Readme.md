# Songs Folder

This folder is designed to store songs categorized by mood. To ensure a well-organized structure, please follow the guidelines below:

## Folder Structure

Inside the `songs` folder, you will find five subfolders. Please add your songs to the appropriate folder based on the mood of the song. The folders are:

- `happy/` - For songs that have an upbeat and joyful vibe.
- `sad/` - For songs that are melancholic or evoke feelings of sadness.
- `neutral/` - For songs that have a neutral or calm mood.
- `surprise/` - For songs that evoke a feeling of surprise or excitement.
- `angry/` - For songs that are intense or have an aggressive tone.

## How to Add Songs

1. **Choose the right folder**: Based on the mood of the song, select the appropriate folder.
2. **Upload the song**: Add the song file (e.g., MP3, WAV, etc.) to the relevant folder.
3. **Naming convention (Optional)**: While not mandatory, itâ€™s a good practice to name the song files descriptively (e.g., `happy_song_01.mp3`, `sad_song_02.wav`).
